# script-gen
A neural network which uses the Seinfeld script dataset to generate new scripts

# summary
This model can serve as a basis for future ones. The main issue with this one is that, while it gets the script format correct,
the dialogue is basically nonsense. My favorite example of this is that characters seem to talk to themselves frequently,
especially Jerry. Not uncommon to see


*jerry: (to jerry) I'm going to head to the hospital*

*jerry: well I'm just saying*


The model needs more training and perhaps refinement of hyperparameters to improve these results.
